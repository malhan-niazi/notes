Lesson's Learned:
-installed latest version of nodeJs from website, added the paths to PATH env variable:
export NODEJS_HOME=/usr/local/lib/nodejs/node-v9.8.0-linux-x64
export PATH=$NODEJS_HOME/bin:$PATH

-encountered issue with installing angular cli from npm:
solution:
change npm default directory: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions
added variables to path after adding npm global to user home directory:
export NPM_GLOBAL_PATH=/home/malhan/npm-global
export PATH=$NPM_GLOBAL_PATH/bin:$PATH

GOOD TO KNOW: /etc/skel/ files are copied to all new users that are created. user specific profile
and bash files are found in the ~ directory

All the code is written in the app folder

ng cli: ng new {folder name} to create a new application
        ng serve to start the application

index.html is the file that renders the single page apps

assets folder can contain images and other application assets

environment folder is used for environment variables

app.component.ts contains the main application code (typescript file) contains business logic

app.component.html contains the html manipulations, contains what you see

app.module.ts contains features we can add to the application (imports etc)

to install bootstrap 3: npm install --save bootstrap@3

ng serve to start the project server

angular-cli.json has json values for different modules you want to include in html using webpack

ng generate component {comopnent name} to generate ng components in application

The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) offers nice lists of all properties and events
