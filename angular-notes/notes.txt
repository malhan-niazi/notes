Lesson's Learned:
-installed latest version of nodeJs from website, added the paths to PATH env variable:
export NODEJS_HOME=/usr/local/lib/nodejs/node-v9.8.0-linux-x64
export PATH=$NODEJS_HOME/bin:$PATH

-encountered issue with installing angular cli from npm:
solution:
change npm default directory: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions
added variables to path after adding npm global to user home directory:
export NPM_GLOBAL_PATH=/home/malhan/npm-global
export PATH=$NPM_GLOBAL_PATH/bin:$PATH
